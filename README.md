# Automated Keep-Alive Ping

## Project Overview
The Automated Keep-Alive Ping project is a web application developed to ensure that a specific server remains active and responsive. This application sends an HTTP request to the server and expects a response. It is primarily designed to prevent the server from going into an idle state due to inactivity. (150 words)

## Requirements
The project must meet all the evaluation criteria provided above. It should be a complete, self-contained HTML file with all CSS in style tags and all JavaScript in script tags. The final product should be professional, production-quality code that is responsive (utilizing Bootstrap 5 or custom CSS). The code must also provide proper error handling and comments for complex logic. Importantly, there should be no placeholder comments like "// rest of code here". (100 words)

## Installation & Setup
To install and set up the Automated Keep-Alive Ping application, start by downloading the index.html file. This file contains all the necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for the application. After downloading, open the file in your favorite web browser. If you want to use a different server for the ping, replace 'ping_server_url' in the script section with your server URL. Remember, the server must support CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) for the ping to work. (150 words)

## Usage Instructions
Using the Automated Keep-Alive Ping application is straightforward. Once you have opened the index.html file in your web browser, you will see a button labeled "Ping Server". Click this button to send a ping to the server. If the ping is successful, you will see a message saying "Ping successful". If the ping fails, you will see a message saying "Ping failed" followed by an error message. (150 words)

## Technical Details
The Automated Keep-Alive Ping application is a single-page web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML and CSS handle the structure and design of the page, respectively, while the JavaScript handles the functionality. The JavaScript uses the Fetch API to send an HTTP request to the server and display the result on the page. The application also includes a responsive design, which means it will display correctly on all devices, regardless of screen size. (100 words)

## Troubleshooting
If you are having trouble with the Automated Keep-Alive Ping application, first check to make sure you have entered the correct server URL. If the URL is correct but you are still seeing the "Ping failed" message, your server may not support CORS. To fix this, you will need to configure your server to support CORS.
